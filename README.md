#🐍 2D Snake Game with C++ and SFML
Inspired by the nostalgic OG Nokia Snake game, this project is a modern take with a twist: learning Linked Lists through gameplay. Built using C++ and SFML, this game demonstrates various linked list operations when the snake consumes different types of food.


🎮 Game Overview
In this game, the snake performs linked list operations (both single and double linked lists) based on the type of food it eats. This serves as an interactive way to understand how linked lists work.


Linked List Operations by Food Type:
🍏 APPLE: Delete at Head
🥭 MANGO: Delete at Middle
🍊 ORANGE: Delete at Tail
🍕 PIZZA: Insert at Tail
🍔 BURGER: Insert at Head
🧀 CHEESE: Insert in Middle
☠️ POISON: Delete half the snake (delete half the list)
🍺 ALCOHOL: Reverse snake direction (reverse the linked list)
After consuming food, the corresponding linked list operation and its time complexity are displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.


🔧 Features
Classic Snake gameplay with a modern twist: linked list operations as snake body manipulation.
Display of the linked list operation and time complexity after each food consumption.
Smooth snake movement and dynamic handling of different food types.


🛠️ Linked List Operations
This project was created to reinforce the understanding of single and double linked lists. Operations covered:

Insertions (at head, middle, tail)
Deletions (at head, middle, tail, and half of the snake)
Reversals (entire linked list)
